### Bottle is an MC Server that wont Bottleneck itself like others did before
Bottle is a new Type of Minecraft Server with the Goal to stand out from the Performance Limitations of previous Servers but still be expandable and flexible.

More Details will follow once Bottle is out of the Alpha testing Stage.
This Project will start with Version 1.12.2, no Downsupport planned for the Moment
